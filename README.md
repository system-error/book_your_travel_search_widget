# book_your_travel_search_widget
This code changes the widget in search bar of bookyourtravel theme in wordpress.
The default widget search has in tour type checkboxes. I changed to dropdown menu because I have many different types of tours so it not useful and the search bar getting very big. 


Be careful with the class that calls insite the code. One of the versions of theme had "BYT_Theme_Utils::" (called the class like this), in the version of the theme I have now it calls it like this "BookYourTravel_Theme_Utils::" so be careful.
